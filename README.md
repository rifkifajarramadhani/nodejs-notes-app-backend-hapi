# Node.js RESTful API

This project is a RESTful API built with Node.js, HapiJS, and PostgreSQL. It's designed to provide a solid foundation for building scalable and maintainable server-side applications.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them:

- Node.js (v14 or later recommended)
- npm (normally comes with Node.js)

### Installing

A step-by-step series of examples that tell you how to get a development environment running:

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/rifkifajarramadhani/nodejs-notes-app-backend-hapi.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd nodejs-notes-app-backend-hapi
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

4. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update it with your settings:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

5. Start the server:

```bash
npm start
```

Your API should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Running the tests

Explain how to run the automated tests for this system:

```bash
npm test
```
